# Sound Maze!

## STEREO EARPHONE or HEADPHONE REQUIRED

## Introduction & Method
It is a maze but little bit different thing is... you should find the destination without your eyes.  
At first, you'd better to play with maps (click SHOW MAP after START).  
With visual information, this maze is really easy to solve, you can learn how the maze works.  
Then... if you think you're ready, push START and close your eyes, then try it!  
Good luck.  

Background music indicates the escape point, if you reach the point, you win.  
TRAP activates after 3-times of alert sound, then you die, you should move the other slot before the trap activates.  
If you bump the WALL, it provides special sound feedback, so you can recognize that is blocked by the WALL.  
You can recognize HOLEs are 1-distance away by noise sound feedback, you can find the exact position by turn left & right actions.

Better to learn by experience, please just try it!

Maps are randomly generated, but these always have the path to escape, so... don't worry.

## Discussion
Firstly what I planned was quite harder than this, but it was toooo hard.
So I updated this to make easier (less walls, holes and traps etc...), simplified traps working method, etc...

Thanks!
