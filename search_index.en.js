an open-source SQL database fully written in Rust!\nWritten in Rust, pure functional execution layer, easily swappable storage and web assembly support!\nSummary\n\nGlueSQL provides SQL parser &amp; execution layer as a library\n\nYou can use GlueSQL itself or to make your own SQL database.\n\nSQL parser used: sqlparser-rs\nDefault storage engine: sled\n\n\nThe whole execution layer codes are pure functional\n\nRust is so good for functional programming, there is no mut in entire GlueSQL excution layer codes.\n\nWeb Assembly Support\n\nYou can simply see this,\n\nGlueSQL-js Playground Demo\n\nIt's so so easy to make custom storages\n\nMain repo: GlueSQL-js\n\nFor Description\n\nGlueSQL provides SQL parser &amp; execution layer as a library\n\nLet's just divide SQL database into 4 elements like these below,\n\nSQL Parser\nExecution Layer\nStorage Layer\nManagement Tools (CLI, connecting interfaces, ...)\n\nIn the past, it was very natural to re-implement all that layers when someone wants to make a new SQL database.\nYeah, it was ok, in previous ages..\nThere were only a few number of SQL database implementations before.\nBut how about nowadays?\nSQL, SQL, SQL everywhere...\nWe use SQL database when we make server side application.\nWe also use SQL database when we make complicated frontend application.\nBig data analysis? They also provide SQL syntax support.\nSQL database is not good for horizontal scaling?\nNo! Thanks to Raft, now we don't need to worry about manual sharding, something bothersomes anymore.\nStill it makes sense to re-implement all that layers when we make a new SQL database?\nI don't think so.\nRecently, what we are mainly focusing is \"Storage Layer\".\nThough there already exists lots of SQL database implementations but the reason we still make new ones are mainly because of \"storage\".\nSpecialize for big data analysis, streaming data, or horizontal scalability, ...\nIt's not usually because of SQL parser or execution layer.\nThen...\nWhy not making them as a re-usable library?\nThat was my main motivation to start this project.\n(Above is a cool version, my actual motivation was may be... I just wanted to make something using Rust.)\nGlueSQL provides very simple way to make custom storage.\nUsing Rust traits!\nWhat you only need to do is implementing a few store traits, for now it is only two traits: Store, StoreMut\n\nThe whole execution layer codes are pure functional\n\nUsing database, we store something.\nIt's very obvious, it is stateful, and very mutable.\nSo at least for Storage Layer, it's unavoidable not to use mutables.\nThen in the case of SQL Parser and Execution Layer?\nAt first, it's ok to implement SQL parser functionally.\nRole of SQL parser is, converting raw SQL string into AST.\ninput and output are very clear, so it looks ok.\nThen how about execution layer?\nIt's not that different, execution layer is just in between parser and storage layers.\nWow, input and output are also very clear like SQL parser.\nThere's no need of storing something in execution layer, theoretically.\nRole of execution layer is just delivering message properly from parser to storage layer.\nAnd Rust provides very straight forward way to write pure functional codes.\nWhat we only need to is forgetting what mut keyword is.\nThen it's all ok, only issue is.. it might be little bit more painful to write code at first.\nBut that pain is worth enough to pay, then we can see side-effect free and easily debuggable codes.\n\nWeb Assembly Support\n\nIt may be not directly related to GlueSQL itself.\nBut... as you know... Rust provides very good WebAssembly supports, and GlueSQL is entirely written in Rust.\nThere no way for me not to make WebAssembly build, it attracted me toooo much.\nSo I did it, here is it.\nLet's just begin with this demo\n\nGlueSQL-js Playground\n\nThat demo is not something connecting to remote databases, SQL databse itself runs in web browsers!\nIt currently provides 3 storage options:\n\nMemory\nlocalStorage\nsessionStorage\n\nYou can see the code in this repo: gluesql-js-demo\nOne more interesting stuff, demo uses GlueSQL itself for state management which is often taken by Redux.\nMain repo is this: GlueSQL-js\nIt's just a beginning\nNow version I set is only v0.1.*,\nThere are tons of features to implement.\nI'll keep working on GlueSQL, and I also hope some of you feel interested in this project and do something together.\nPlans\n\nMore SQL syntax &amp; feature support.\nBecome a promising new generation of WebSQL.\nMake something Redux alternative using GlueSQL!\nCompete with SQLite.\nBe Serde in SQL database world.\n\n","id":"https://taehoon.dev/blog/introducing-gluesql/","title":"Introducing GlueSQL"},"https://taehoon.dev/blog/setup/":{"body":"I just started my own blog!\nIt's a first article and so let's begin by writing whatever.\nLet me simply introduce what the tool I used for building this blog.\nAnd my choice is Zola!\n\nZola is A fast static site generator in a single binary with everything built-in.\n\nBefore I decided what blogging platform to use, my requirements were these below:\n\nMarkdown support\n\nIt's very natural to use WYSIWYG editors to write article, yeah, but...\nAt this point, I wanted to manage my blog contents using git but using WYSIWIG editors it can be quite tough.\nIn usual cases, contents generated by WYSIWIG editors are not only that human-readable,\nbut also it is hard to replace an existing WYSIWIG editor to other one.\nGetting stuck at something, that's something I'd really liked to avoid.\nThen Markdown can be a very proper choice.\nIt's very portable and Markdown is also human-readable itself.\nI don't need to worry about this kind of scenario: what should I do when my blogging platform is shutdown or outdated..?\nUsing Markdown, it's quite easy to move to any other blogging platforms.\n\nStatic site generator\n\nNowadays Web is not only for making something documents to read.\nWe can now make almost whatever in web development environment.\nAnd for me, that was even the main source of my income for a last few years.\nI made lots of complex websites and web based applications.\nBut for blogging, that can be too much.\nStatic HTML is just enough for building something... website for readings.\n...blah blah blah...\nI... just don't want to take care about updating React version for running my blog.\n\nWritten in Rust\n\nVery simple reason, I like Rust, I love Rust\nso if there exists static site generator written in Rust, why not using that?\nMaybe I can even contribute to the project in the future.\nIf that static site generator is written in PHP, though I choose that,\nI will not ever consider to contribute to the project.\nBut for Rust project, I can happily do something for free.\nZola\nAnd Zola satisfies all 3 requirements, so I chose it.\n","id":"https://taehoon.dev/blog/setup/","title":"First article - Zola is cool"}},"docInfo":{"https://taehoon.dev/":{"body":40,"title":2},"https://taehoon.dev/blog/":{"body":3,"title":0},"https://taehoon.dev/blog/introducing-gluesql/":{"body":485,"title":2},"https://taehoon.dev/blog/setup/":{"body":198,"title":4}},"length":4},"lang":"English"};
